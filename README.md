Perspective was a school-project born in the class "Technical Concepts for Media" at the LMU Munich. The class spanned one semester and corresponded to 12 ECTS. The purpose of the class was to develop a media application using agile methodologies, and "Perspective" is the result of that work. As such, the code was never meant for production, but rather meant as only a school-project. 

The vision of the project was to create a news app that could present short summarized news stories to users using scraping technology and text summarization, while also presenting different perspectives related to the stories. Such perspectives could for example be Youtube-videos with related background-content, related tweets, or longer news articles offering  different angles of the stories.
